..*Installed the scikit by using command pip install -U scikit-learn
..*Installed Matplot by using commands
..*python -mpip install -U pip
..*python -mpip install -U matplotlib
..*Installed numpy, scipy with pip
..*We took the dataset and divide it as test data and train data.
..*The data was cleaned before performing any vectorisation and feature selection on it.
..*After cleaning the data, it was passed further for feature vector and feature selection.
..*Python script was written in order to perform the vectorisation on the data.
..*After performing the vectorisation, matrix was generated; the matrix generated was sparse
matrix.
..*Then we use the Truncated SVD for plotting the sparse matrix.
